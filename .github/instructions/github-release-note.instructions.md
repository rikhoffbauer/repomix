# GitHub Release Note Guidelines
When writing release notes, please follow these guidelines:

- When referencing issues or PRs, use the gh command to verify the content:
  ```bash
  gh issue view <issue-number>  # For checking issue content
  gh pr view <pr-number>        # For checking PR content
  ```
  This helps ensure accuracy in release note descriptions.

Here are some examples of release notes that follow the guidelines:

v0.2.25
````md
This release brings significant improvements to output formatting and introduces flexible remote repository handling capabilities along with enhanced logging features.

# Improvements ‚ö°

## Remote Repository Enhancement (#335)
- Added branch/tag parsing directly from repository URLs:
```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/0.1.x
```
Functions identically to:
```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 0.1.x
```

Special thanks to @huy-trn for implementing this user-friendly feature!

## Enhanced Output Formatting (#328, #329, #330)
- Added "End of Codebase" marker for better clarity in output
- Improved output header accuracy:
  - Better representation of codebase scope
  - Clear indication when using `--include` or `--ignore` options

Special thanks to @gitkenan for adding the "End of Codebase" marker and reporting the header issue!

## Path Pattern Support (#337)
- Added support for special characters in paths:
  - Handles parentheses in include patterns (e.g., `src/(categories)/**/*`)
  - Improved escaping for `[]` and `{}`
  - Essential for Next.js route groups and similar frameworks

Thank you @matheuscoelhomalta for improving path pattern support!

# How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix

This release adds significant performance improvements for large repositories, making Repomix faster and more efficient when needed.

# Improvements ‚ö°

## Parallel Processing Enhancement (#309)
- Implemented worker threads using [Piscina](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina) for parallel processing

### Benchmark Results
- `yamadashy.repomix`: No significant change
  - Before: 868.73 millis
  - After: 671.26 millis
- `facebook/react`: 29x faster
  - Before: 123.31 secs
  - After: 4.19 secs

  - Before: 17.85 mins
  - After: 17.27 secs

Note: While Repomix is not primarily designed for processing large repositories, and speed is not a primary goal, faster processing can provide a better user experience when working with larger codebases.

# How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
